[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c84790b2-6721-4357-bb47-4f5a14a36f28/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bryanpan/deploys)

Welcome to my portfolio! I built it completely through Next.js and Sass.

## Getting Started

I prefer [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) as my package
manager.

The basic commands to get this repository and start are:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BryanPan342/bryan.pan.git
$ cd bryan.pan
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

## Documentation

I wrote some documentation on how I build the site! Check it out [here](docs)
